<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>City of Wagga Wagga wants you to have your say on the future of transport within Wagga Wagga</p>

<p>You can use this platform to say where you think a new pedestrian crossing should be build? Or where you think a new bicycle path should be located? - for example, where should a new park be built?
  Make sure you place pins on the map, add comments, discuss and support other people's suggestions and share locations over twitter and facebook!</p>

<p>This project is <a href="http://openplans.org/shareabouts/">open source/a>, and we welcome your involvement!</p>
