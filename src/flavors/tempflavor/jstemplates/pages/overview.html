<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Greening the Pipeline aims to transform the Main Outfall Sewer reserve into a linear public space that takes a more holistic approach to water management and enhances community livability by:
<ul>
<li>Improving the local amenity</li>
<li>Enhancing community connections &amp; sense of place</li>
<li>Contributing to urban cooling</li>
<li>Enhancing active transport opportunities</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>It is one of the largest infrastructure projects of its kind in Australia and that's why we need you to provide your feedback to shape the project. </p>
