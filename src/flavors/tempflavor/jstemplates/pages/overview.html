<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Melbourne Water, Wyndham City Council, City West Water and Vic Roads are working in partnership to deliver a parkland along decommissioned Main Outfall Sewer (MOS) in Melbourneâ€™s west.  The initiative, known as <a href="http://greeningthepipeline.com.au">"Greening the Pipeline"</a>, aims to maximise community value from existing community assets: to transform the Main Outfall Sewer reserve into a linear parkland that takes a more holistic approach to water management and enhances community livability by:
<ul>
<li>Improve health and wellbeing</li>
<li>Activate community sense of place</li>
<li>Enhance active transport links</li>
<li>Create resilient open space</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Greening the Pipeline initiative provides an opportunity to create a unique parkland. We need your feedback to help shape the design. </p>
