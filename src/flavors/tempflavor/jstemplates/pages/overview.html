<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>The initiative, known as <a href="http://greeningthepipeline.com.au">"Greening the Pipeline"</a> aims to maximise community value from existing community assets: to transform the Main Outfall Sewer and Federation Trail reserve into a linear parkland.</p>

<p>We are currently seeking ideas for the parkland. Your ideas and support will help with grant applications to fund this project, and hopefully together we can bring this vision to life to:
<ul>
<li>Improving health and wellbeing</li>
<li>Activating community sense of place</li>
<li>Enhancing active transport links</li>
<li>Creating resilient open space</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Melbourne Water, Wyndham City Council, City West Water and VicRoads are working in partnership to deliver this vision.</p>
